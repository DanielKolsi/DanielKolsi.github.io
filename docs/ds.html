<h1>Developer story of Daniel Kolsi (being updated weekly, last update 12th May 2017)</h1>
<p>
<h3>My aim as a software engineer: </h3>
  Build something that helps normal people in their concrete daily life
  Learn from own and others' failures.
  I'm especially interested in analysing the reasons why large, often public sector or government,
  software projects seem to fail both regarding to budget and schedule.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects
</p>
  <p>
    I try to avoid the same mistakes ;-) I always strive to understand the reasons behind the code;
    why and how something should be done and how it will eventually help people?
  </p>
<h3>The beginning</h3>
<p>
I've probably written my first code lines with SVI 318 Basic. My memories are foggy, but I remember
doing modifications to the Basic tutorial programs I loaded from tape. At that time I was more interested
about games, but also the games were mostly very simple and boring.
</p>
<p>
As I got my C128 some years later, I was initially too enthusiastic about the great games available for C64
that I didn't care much about unleashing the "great" power of C128. These years were mostly spent on playing games,
though the seeds were sown and I was deliberately hooked on the potential of Commodore computers.
</p>
<h3> Amiga demoscene </h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  In Finland, I've especially been following for years a megalomanic healthcare software project
  called "Apotti". It was originally budgeted for 350M€, but it's current overall budget has
  already raised to 600M€. Even before the implementation part was officially started, the project
  has been plagued and stalled by court cases regarding the vendor. The project was officially
  launched in 2012 and the deployment should be finished in 2021. The project is closed source.
</p>
  I've been personally involved in one huge software project that failed. (The company
  went off the business.) I think this has been one of my greatest experience in the
  software engineering industry - in the sense what I've learned for the future and
  how I've been inclined regarding to further projects I've been and will be participating.
<p>
  I prefer agile methods, quick prototyping, small teams, flat organization
  and knowledge and skill driven decisions equipped with brutal honesty. Generally I'm
  not very opinionated about the used technologies; the best suited for the current
  goals and situation should be used without "premature optimization".
<p>
  Sometimes it's important to realise as soon as possible that the project or product will fail. This
  should be taken as part of the learning process for building other succesfull projects.
  Failures are part of the success if they're spotted and honestly realised early enough.
  Terminating failed or unrealistic projects should be part of the daily toolkit.
</p>
<p>
  Project doctor / project terminator

  From my and others' experience, I've been developing heuristics and methods to avoid
  megalomanic software project failures.

  In a small scale, failures should happen all the time and the feedback from them should be used
  from quick cycles. Also, failures should be recognized as early has possible. The most successful
  software company in Finland, Supercell, actually celebrates the learnings from failures:

<p>
Some examples of meaningful software projects I've been participating:
Kirjasilta, www.kirjasilta.net (being updated continuously since 2000!)
</p>
<p>
This was both an university project and hobby project. Thanks to Risto, it has been
continously updated with new content and has been in use in different countries.
I was responsible for the initial HTML + Javascript implementation. The other
members were Jari (HTML, content) and Risto (content).
</p>
<p>
Mass spectrometry visualizer
</p>
This was a special interactive utilify for visualizing mass spectrometry sample data. I was responsible
for the Java implementation in a small team consisting of a mathematician and bioinformatician.
The development was supervised by our CEO, who also is a professor in medicine. It was very pleasant
time working together with this small team and I was happy as this application was well received.
Unfortunately it couldn't save the company from its fate - we suggested selling it separately, but the
company owner didn't quite warm for the idea.
</p>
<p>
GPSMeet / FaceOP - Operating face-to-face profile matched group meetings
</p>
<p>
The aim for this app is to establish face-to-face profile matched group meetings. The meetings
are matched by user written profile criteria. More info: http://www.faceop.com
</p>
<p>
GPSMeet was the "alpha" version of FaceOP, initially drafted for iOS (Objective C) and later in
Javascript for Appery.io cloud environment. Since 2015, the development has been made for Android
devices. Beta version has been available at Google Play since late 2016. The application is under
constant development and testing.

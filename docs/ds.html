Dev story of Daniel Kolsi

My aim as a software engineer:
  Build something that helps normal people in their concrete daily life
  Learn from own and others' failures.
  I'm especially interested in analysing the reasons why large, often public sector or government,
  software projects seem to fail both regarding to budget and schedule.

  In Finland, I've especially been following for years a megalomanic healthcare software project
  called "Apotti". It was originally budgeted for 350M€, but it's current overall budget has
  already raised to 600M€. Even before the implementation part was officially started, the project
  has been plagued and stalled by court cases regarding the vendor. The project was officially
  launched in 2012 and the deployment should be finished in 2021.

  From my and others' experience, I've been developing heuristics and methods to avoid
  megalomanic software project failures.

  In a small scale, failures should happen all the time and the feedback from them should be used
  from quick cycles. Also, failures should be recognized as early has possible. The most successful
  software company in Finland, Supercell, actually celebrates the learnings from failures:
